<h1> Requirements </h1>
Make sure you do the following to successfully complete the projec:

<h3> Code Quality </h3>

- Use HTML to build websites
- Use CSS selectors to specify display ased on an element's characteristics
- Manipulate the DOM using Javascript
- Manipulate the conten and styling on the page by utilizing DOM Events and Event Listeners
- Use Flexbox and Grid to layout a page

<h3> Interactive site </h3>

Use your JavaScript and DOM skills to make your site interactive. In other words, there should be at least one place where clicking, selecting, hovering, or submitting information changes the content of the page.

Here are a few ideas to consider trying:

- Clicking on a button expands to show more details or text.
- Clicking on a button sorts a list of things (ascending or descending).
- Clicking on a button or selecting an option filters a list of things (example: show all photos, show only travel photos)
- Instead of navigating to different pages, show and hide page content using JavaScript without loading a new page.
- Entering information in a form adds content to the page or changes the page content
- Your own creative idea!
  
<h3> Pages or Sections </h3>
  
  You can choose to make your site one long page broken up into sections, or your site can have a few different pages.

Your site needs to implement all user stories and meet the UI/UX criteria. There are many ways to structure your site to do this. Personal sites often have some or all of these pages:

1. Landing/Home Page: Your homepage is the first page that appears when the site loads. You know what a homepage is. You can put whatever you want here!

2. About/Intro: The about page is where you get to talk about yourself. Do you have a pop pitch? This is the place to put it. Write a bio. Show a picture. Talk about your love of cats, books, or milkshakes. Make this part personal. You can have combine this section wit your landing page if it makes sense.

3. Contact links: You can put it at the bottom of your page as a footer or in a contact me section. A good font with tons of social icons is [FontAwesome](fontawesome.com)

4. Other: (Optional) Anything else with things you may want to include, if you write, then a blog section, if you paint or photograph then a gallery section, projects you might be working on etc.

<h3> Hints for showing and hiding elements </h3>
  
  **CSS based approach**

- What CSS attribute can we use to make an element hidden?
- Can we give an HTML element a CSS class that is styled to make itself hidden?
- Can we create an extra class that would make the same element visible?
- How can we use DOM events and JavaScript to add and remove classes from elements?

  **JS based approach**

- Can we store information that we want to show or hide in our JavaScript file instead of in HTML?
- How can we use JavaScript to keep track of what things are supposed to be shown or hidden?
- How can we use DOM events and JavaScript to change or replace the HTML or text content of an element when we want to show or hide something?
