<h1> Requirements </h1>
Make sure you do the following to successfully complete the projec:

<h3> Code Quality </h3>

- Use HTML to build websites
- Use CSS selectors to specify display ased on an element's characteristics
- Manipulate the DOM using Javascript<!---Maybe--->
- Manipulate the content and styling on the page by utilizing DOM Events and Event Listeners <!---Maybe--->
- Use Flexbox and Grid to layout a page

<h3> Interactive site </h3>

Use your JavaScript and DOM skills to make your site interactive. In other words, there should be at least one place where clicking, selecting, hovering, or submitting information changes the content of the page.

Here are a few ideas to consider trying:

- Clicking on a button expands to show more details or text.
- Clicking on a button sorts a list of things (ascending or descending).
- Clicking on a button or selecting an option filters a list of things.
- Instead of navigating to different pages, show and hide page content using JavaScript without loading a new page.
- Filtering
- Your own creative idea!
  
<h3> Pages or Sections </h3>
  
You can choose to make your site one long page broken up into sections, or your site can have a few different pages.

Your site needs ulitize a API to update internships for the future. There are many ways to structure your site to do this. Job Boards sites often have some or all of these pages:

1. Landing/Home Page: Your homepage is the first page that appears when the site loads. You know what a homepage is. You can put whatever you want here!

2. About/Intro -Websites mission statement, purpose of the page and oppurtinuties listed.
   
3. Resources - Resources for upcomming jobs and career fairs and events.

  
  **CSS based approach**

- What CSS attribute can we use to make an element hidden?
- Can we give an HTML element a CSS class that is styled to make itself hidden?
- Can we create an extra class that would make the same element visible?
- How can we use DOM events and JavaScript to add and remove classes from elements?

  **JS based approach**

- Can we store information that we want to show or hide in our JavaScript file instead of in HTML?
- How can we use JavaScript to keep track of what things are supposed to be shown or hidden?
- How can we use DOM events and JavaScript to change or replace the HTML or text content of an element when we want to show or hide something?
